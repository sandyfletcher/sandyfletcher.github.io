                        <p>I'm a quick learner, but get distracted easily.  This combination has pushed me to be something of a generalist — competent in a wide variety of fields but perpetually deferring to those with the dedication to specialize.</p>
                        <p>I bring value by deeply understanding how systems interact, asking thoughtful questions, and explaining information of any complexity to audiences of any expertise.</p>

Circumstance has changed my perspective from something resembling a desire for meritocracy towards a greater understanding of the unappreciated value of perseverence — how will frequently outperforms talent and how coasting is a disservice to oneself.    If you'd like to collaborate, I've streamlined the process <a href="/contact/">HERE</a>.</p>
