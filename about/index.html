                        I was introduced to Web Development earlier this year, and have decided to pursue it full-time.

                        I learn quickly, but tend to be easily distracted.
                        Programming has been an excellent playground for my curiosity, since each tangent I follow only adds to my understanding and sharpens my skills.
                        You can see a writeup of how each project came to fruition <a href="/building/">here</a>, along with the source code if you'd like to make your own version.

                        I'm currently enrolled at Harvard, so please forgive the projects for being more prototype than polish.
                        Please <a href="/contact/">reach out</a> if you're interested in collaborating, as I will be pursuing Software Engineering positions once my schooling is complete.
