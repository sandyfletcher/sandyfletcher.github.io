                            I was introduced to Web Development earlier this year, and decided to pursue it full-time.

                            I learn quickly, but have a tendency to be easily distracted.
                            Computer Science has provided a playground for my curiosity where tangents are productive, and the rigid structure of language architecture keeps me from straying too far outside the lines.
                            I'm currently enrolled as a student at Harvard, so please forgive my projects currently being more prototype than polish.
