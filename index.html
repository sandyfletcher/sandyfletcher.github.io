				<h2 class="major">HTML</h2>
				<section>
					<p>In the 1980s, researchers at CERN were working with thousands of complex documents that all referenced each other - think early Wikipedia.  Employee/Computer Scientist Tim Berners-Lee proposed a system built off hypertext - links that create and navigate a vast network of unique pages.  He later built off this idea to create Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the structural backbone of the modern internet.</p>
					<p>HTML was designed for non-technical users to understand, so the layout is familiar and essay-esque.  It starts with a &lt;header&gt; to introduce basic information about the site, the &lt;body&gt; to contain the bulk of the page content, and closing with a &lt;footer&gt; to leave the reader with signatures and closing information.  To get a better understanding, let's get our hands dirty and make a site of our own:</p>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/html1.png" alt="Desktop/New/Text Document" /></span>
					<p>All computer code is written text, and HTML is no exception.  All those videos you watch and pictures you see boil down to a basic text link eventually.  That means you don’t need anything fancy to get started writing your code, just anywhere you can write some basic text.  If you’re a Windows person, right-click anywhere on the Desktop to create a new text file.</p>
					<p>I've prepared some code for you to copy into that file.  Make sure you swap your name into the header so it displays properly.</p>
					<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;_______'s Website&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;header&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to Websites!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;A place to experiment with HTML features.&lt;/h2&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;(placeholder for navigation bar)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Change basic styling and size for text.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;/br&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;h1&gt;FALLING&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;DOWN&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A TALL&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;h4&gt;WELL&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;h5&gt;splash&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;
  &lt;a href="youraccount@yoursocial.com"&gt;Say hi&lt;/a&gt;!
&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;		</code></pre>
					<p>The first thing any code needs to do is declare its filetype.  By introducing an HTML file, we can ensure that every browser on the planet knows what to expect and how to display our content.  That flexibility is important, since our planet is populated with different devices displaying different screen sizes using different programs.  Expect to introduce more lines of code designed for compatibility as we move forward.</p>
					<p>Once we have the computer speaking our language, we hit 'em with the introduction, AKA &lt;header&gt;.  As alluded to, this area will hold more style definition later on, but for now we can use it to give our website a title in web browsers and get a declaration out there about the nature of the site and what it's here to do.  Seems silly when it's just us messing around, but big-name companies use the header section to optimize search results and drive millions of users towards their sites over competitors.  It's worth getting right!</p>
					<p>To show off the "paragraph" tag I threw in a line with &lt;p&gt; before closing out the section with &lt;/head&gt;.  From there we open the main content of the site with &lt;body&gt;  and show off how we can use font sizes to separate ideas.  When we run out of ideas, don't forget to close out the section with &lt;/body&gt;.  Last part is a simple &lt;footer&gt; where we can include some contact information in case anyone falls in love with our minimalist web design.  With the whole thing done, we finalize everything with &lt;/html&gt;.</p>
					<p>Now that we have the code written into the text editor, save the file on your Desktop and right-click to rename the file.  Text files and HTML files aren't so different, so you can just switch out the suffix from "txt" to "html".  You might get a message that you're making things unstable, but that's the nature of experimentation and everyone will survive.  Now when you open the file, it won't be an editable text file, it'll be a website in your browser!</p>
					<p>If you want to make any changes, simply switch the filetype back to ".txt" and swap out any info you'd like - it's your site!  When you're ready, we'll add another chunk of code to the header section to create a navigation bar:</p>
					<pre><code>&lt;nav&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#home">Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#about">About Us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#services">Services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#contact">Contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/nav&gt;</code></pre>
					<p>Setting up tables doesn't seem like it'd be that interesting, but as we learn more coding languages you realize that they like to use these tables as containers that new toys can be stuck into.  For now, they're just there to hold data like an online Excel document.</p>
					<p>Next up is XXX feature, does YYY.</p>
					<p>Admittedly, our website is a little ugly.  Before we go any further, let's think about what we'd like to add.  A little bit of colour would go a long way, and maybe a nicer font.  Maybe things would light up when we hover over them, maybe we could even have a dark mode so the website isn't blinding at night.  These improvements will require adding new programming languages to our repertoire, but don't be intimidated - all we need to do is dip our toe in the new features, using only the parts we need to execute on our ideas.</p>
