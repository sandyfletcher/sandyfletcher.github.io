                        Computers are a series of electrical transistors - small machines that embody "yes" and "no".  We shortened that further by describing permissions as 1 and 0, and that perfect flash of efficiency went on to build a sloppy and terrible paradise.

                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <p>Something made with love is bursting at the seams.  Super Mario ran into a memory constraint with the NES cartridge it was designed for, but rather than ship fewer levels the designers got creative and reused assets.  You never noticed the clouds are the same exact shape as the trees, but you noticed that there are 8 entire worlds to explore.

                        You will encounter this fork in the road repeatedly with computers.</p>

                    <h2>The Solution</h2>
                    <p>This is what I know about computers:

                        1 They do exactly as they're told
                        2 They don't speak the same language you do
                    
                        Computers are just checking what electrical connections are active, but we make sense of it in 0s and 1s - the binary of whether something's off or on.  That makes for a dreadfully longwinded way of speaking, though:
                        0111001101101000011011110111001001110100
                        ==
                        "short" in binary
                        
                        A shorthand was needed, and 
                        
                        The first thing to understand about computers is that you no longer speak to them directly.  Computers speak in binary, like "011001110", but it isn't practical for us to format our requests like that, so in 19XX we created Assembly, a language that turns binary into something closer to math - a language we can make sense of.  19XX brought C, where we use actual english words, and in modern times you can build an entire computer project using almost ONLY English, and that phenomenon can be expected to continue.
                        
                        In 19XX we got the clever idea of connecting computers across long distances, and that necessitated a standardized way to communicate.  Researchers at CERN developed HTML, and to this day it remains the underlying backbone of the entire internet as we know it.  It only makes sense that we dig around a bit under the hood.</p>
