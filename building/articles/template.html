                        This is the hook. A concise, engaging paragraph that summarizes the project. What is it? What problem does it solve? For example: <em>This project is a web-based utility for generating custom QR codes, built with vanilla JavaScript and demonstrating real-time DOM manipulation.</em>

                    <p>
                        Describe the initial challenge or objective. What was the "why" behind building this? Were you trying to learn a specific technology, solve a personal problem, or explore a design concept? This sets the context for all the decisions that follow.
                    </p>

                    <h2>My Approach & Key Decisions</h2>
                    <p>
                        Walk the reader through your process. This is the core of the write-up. Talk about the technical choices you made and, more importantly, <em>why</em> you made them. Did you choose a grid over flexbox for a layout? Why? Did you structure your JavaScript in a particular way? Explain the reasoning.
                    </p>

                    <div class="code-block">
                        <pre><code>
// A meaningful code snippet is more powerful than a generic one.
// Explain what this code does and why it's important to the project.
function yourAwesomeFunction() {
  console.log("This code demonstrates a key concept.");
}
                        </code></pre>
                    </div>

                        <li><strong>Feature One:</strong> A short description of a standout feature.</li>
                        <li><strong>Feature Two:</strong> Explain another compelling aspect of the project.</li>
                        <li><strong>Feature Three:</strong> Highlight a technical or design achievement.</li>
                    </ul>

                        Conclude with your reflections. What were the biggest challenges? What would you do differently next time? What new skills did you gain? This section is incredibly valuable as it shows growth and critical thinking.
