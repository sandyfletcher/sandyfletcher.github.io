                        Detweeter is a desktop application designed for digital housekeeping. It empowers users to automatically delete their old tweets directly from their computer, offering a straightforward solution for managing one's online history without needing to navigate complex, costly APIs.

                    <h2>The Goal</h2>
                    <p>
                        Social media archives can become a liability, and the manual process of deleting tweets is tedious. With the increasing restrictions and costs of the X (formerly Twitter) API, a programmatic solution seemed out of reach for most users. The goal was to build a reliable, user-friendly tool that circumvents the API by automating the actions a real user would take in a web browser, providing a free and effective way to clean up a user's timeline.
                    </p>

                    <h2>My Approach & Key Decisions</h2>
                    <p>
                        The project was built in Python, leveraging its robust ecosystem for automation and GUI development. The core of the application relies on <strong>Selenium</strong> for web browser automation and <strong>Tkinter</strong> for the graphical user interface. A key design principle was user safety and control, which led to the implementation of a feature to automatically skip any tweet that the user has bookmarked. To ensure the GUI remains responsive, the main automation logic runs in a separate thread.
                    </p>

                    <div class="code-block">
                        <pre><code>
# This function contains the core logic for processing a single tweet.
def process_tweet(tweet, settings, wait, driver):
    try:
        # ... logic to check author, bookmarks, and delete ...
        more_options_button = tweet.find_element(*LOCATORS["MORE_OPTIONS_BUTTON"])
        driver.execute_script("arguments[0].click();", more_options_button)
        
        delete_item = wait.until(EC.element_to_be_clickable(LOCATORS["DELETE_MENU_ITEM"]))
        driver.execute_script("arguments[0].click();", delete_item)
        
        confirm_button = wait.until(EC.element_to_be_clickable(LOCATORS["DELETE_CONFIRM_BUTTON"]))
        driver.execute_script("arguments[0].click();", confirm_button)

        wait.until(EC.staleness_of(tweet)) // Wait for tweet to disappear
        return 'DELETED'
    except Exception:
        return 'ERROR'
                        </code></pre>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Key Features</h3>
                    <ul class="feature-list">
                        <li><strong>Cross-Browser Support:</strong> Works with both Firefox and Chrome, automatically managed by `webdriver-manager`.</li>
                        <li><strong>Two Deletion Modes:</strong> Users can choose to delete everything or specify the 'N' most recent tweets.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bookmark Protection:</strong> Automatically identifies and skips bookmarked tweets, preserving important content.</li>
                        <li><strong>Responsive GUI:</strong> A custom-styled Tkinter interface provides real-time progress logging without freezing, thanks to multi-threading.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                    <p>
                        Building Detweeter was a deep dive into the challenges of web automation on a dynamic, modern web application. I learned the importance of explicit waits (`WebDriverWait`), handling stale element exceptions, and building resilient selectors to deal with a constantly changing front-end. It was also a valuable exercise in designing a user-friendly GUI for a command-line process, reinforcing the importance of clear feedback and non-blocking operations.
