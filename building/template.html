                    <h3>Inspiration / Goal</h3>
                    <p>
                        Describe the initial challenge or objective. What was the "why" behind building this? Were you trying to learn a specific technology, solve a personal problem, or explore a design concept? This sets the context for all the decisions that follow.
                        For example: <em>"I wanted to build a tool that was faster and more private than online alternatives, while also giving me a practical project to deepen my understanding of the Fetch API and CSS Flexbox."</em>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Approach & Key Decisions</h3>
                    <p>
                        Walk the reader through your process. This is the core of the write-up. Talk about the technical choices you made and, more importantly, <em>why</em> you made them. Did you choose a grid over flexbox for a layout? Why? Did you structure your JavaScript in a particular way? Explain the reasoning.
                    </p>

                    <p>Use a list to highlight the most important features or outcomes of the project. This makes it easy for visitors to scan.</p>
                    <ul class="feature-list">
                        <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> The layout fluidly adapts from mobile to desktop screens using CSS Grid and clamp functions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dynamic Content Loading:</strong> Utilized the Fetch API to load external data without a page refresh, as seen with the site's sidebar.</li>
                        <li><strong>Accessible Forms:</strong> Ensured all form inputs have associated labels and proper focus states for keyboard navigation.</li>
                    </ul>
