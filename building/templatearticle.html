                        This is the hook. A concise, engaging paragraph that summarizes the project. What is it? What problem does it solve? For example: <em>This project is a web-based utility for generating custom QR codes, built with vanilla JavaScript and demonstrating real-time DOM manipulation.</em>

                    <h2>The Goal</h2>
                    <p>
                        Describe the initial challenge or objective. What was the "why" behind building this? Were you trying to learn a specific technology, solve a personal problem, or explore a design concept? This sets the context for all the decisions that follow.
                        For example: <em>"I wanted to build a tool that was faster and more private than online alternatives, while also giving me a practical project to deepen my understanding of the Fetch API and CSS Flexbox."</em>
                    </p>

                    <h2>My Approach & Key Decisions</h2>
                    <p>
                        Walk the reader through your process. This is the core of the write-up. Talk about the technical choices you made and, more importantly, <em>why</em> you made them. Did you choose a grid over flexbox for a layout? Why? Did you structure your JavaScript in a particular way? Explain the reasoning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can link to external resources or concepts, like this reference to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MDN page for the Fetch API</a>. It shows you're engaging with the broader development community.
                    </p>

                        <pre><code>
// A meaningful code snippet is more powerful than a generic one.
// Explain what this code does and why it's important to the project.
async function fetchData(url) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;

                    <h3>Key Features</h3>
                    <p>Use a list to highlight the most important features or outcomes of the project. This makes it easy for visitors to scan.</p>
                    <ul class="feature-list">
                        <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> The layout fluidly adapts from mobile to desktop screens using CSS Grid and clamp functions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dynamic Content Loading:</strong> Utilized the Fetch API to load external data without a page refresh, as seen with the site's sidebar.</li>
                        <li><strong>Accessible Forms:</strong> Ensured all form inputs have associated labels and proper focus states for keyboard navigation.</li>
                    </ul>
