                    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
                    <p>
                        There's something very special about moving out, living unencumbered by the parental albatross you've worn as a turtleneck since birth.
                        Typically, it's an opportunity for people to let loose, eating ice cream for breakfast and liquor for lunch.
                        I used the absence of oversight to allocate a larger chunk of my day to computer games.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If someone said that time was wasted, they'd only be mostly right.
                        Imagine a movie critic who's only seen a handful of movies — would their insights have any depth?
                        Well, I've spent my time in the digital trenches, side-by-side with my roommates as we ruined our postures hunched over laptops.
                        Recently I found myself reminiscing on this period, living in squalor but loving it, and a particular favourite game of ours game to mind: Galcon.
                    <p>
                        Short for "Galactic Conquest", it was an online multiplayer space battle, akin to Risk but in real-time.
                        At the time I gave it little thought, but the website worked really well.
                        There was an abundance of players, matchmaking was speedy, and the gameplay nailed that addictive balance between skill and luck.
                        Unfortunately for us the game's popularity eventually ended up making it less accessible, and only years later do I understand why.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The adage "there's no such thing as a free lunch" is the easiest way to understand something ostensibly permanent like a website slipping out of existence.
                        Computers use electricity, and acquiring that electricity has a cost.
                        When you access a website, you're essentially asking to access someone else's computer, and they're the ones who pick up the tab to process your request.
                        If all you're requesting is a tiny bit of data like today's temperature, that won't be a very large bill, but Galcon was serving hundreds of concurrent users — users requesting a low-latency game against opponents around the world, not a two-digit number.
                        The developers chose to pivot from the website we loved to an app with an initial purchase cost, an approach which would offset the computing costs and provide some operational flexibility.
                        It's a logical decision, but one that inevitably curtails the number of new players discovering the game moving forward, and the march towards obscurity is much quicker in a landscape of downhill trends.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project intends to reignite interest and evaluate whether Galcon has the strategic depth worthy of joining Chess, Go, and DoTA2 as an AI battleground.
                        I'll begin by attempting to recreate the game as faithfully as possible, ideally so that someone who's never experienced it can get caught up and enjoy the action.
                        From there I'll convert it into an arena for LLMs to test their mettle, asking frontier models to generate their own battlebot and pitting them against each other as another data point in our collective attempt to benchmark intelligence.
                        That will likely be the extent of the project, but if the results are intriguing I may use this as an avenue to investigate machine learning and attempt to craft the ultimate pilot for galactic conquest... for self-defense of course!
                    </p>
                    <h3>Initial Steps</h3>
                    <p>
                        At this point in my coding journey I don't have sophiticated tools at my disposal.
                        The only programming language I'm familiar with capable of conditional choices is JavaScript, so that'll be what powers both the arena architecture and the battlebots within.
                        I set up a basic website to hold the site content using HTML and CSS, and for simplicity's sake I've made it inflexible in the sense that it'll display essentially the same on web as mobile and won't be compatible with landscape mode.
                        I've gone with a minimalist aesthetic mostly as personal preference, but fewer distractions helps users understand how to proceed more intuitively.
                        If something's on-screen, let's ensure it has a clear purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After applying this philosophy to the menus, fiddling with fonts, and ensuring there's visual consistency across platforms and viewport sizes, we're ready to conceptualize recreating the game itself.
                        The core of the gameplay is that planets generate troops at a rate relative to their size, and these troops can be dispatched to neighbouring planets to seize control.
                        Naturally, some planets become contested as players vie for their production capabilities, and troops in combat are traded through mutual attrition.
                        Victory is achieved when one player has completely eliminated the opposition, or given to the player with control over the most planets when the timer runs out.
                        From a coding perspective, a lot of this is surprisingly simple when broken down into smaller components.  We're going to need: 
                    </p>
                    <ul class="feature-list">
                        <li><strong>1) MAP GENERATION: </strong>POPULATE THE BATTLEFIELD WITH A SEMI-RANDOM DISTRIBUTION OF PLANETS</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Setting up a uniform aspect ratio across all viewports greatly simplified this step.
                        Instead of worrying about scaling formulas, we can dictate distance with integers and prevent overlap.
                    </p>           
                    <div class="code-block">
                        <pre><code>
this.config = {
    STARTING_PLANET_SIZE: 30,       // each players gets the same start
    PLAYER_TO_NEUTRAL_DISTANCE: 60, // players are given a buffer space
};
                        </code></pre>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Once these guardrails are in place, we can place the starting planets for each player.
                        We'll divide the available area into a number of sections equal to number of participants.
                    </p>     
                    <div class="code-block">
                        <pre><code>
generatePlayerPlanets(players) {
    const playerPlanets = [];
    const playerCount = players.length;
    const { width, height } = this.canvas;
    const planetSize = this.config.STARTING_PLANET_SIZE;
    const cols = Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(playerCount));
    const rows = Math.ceil(playerCount / cols);
    const cellWidth = width / cols;
    const cellHeight = height / rows;
    let chunks = [];
    for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
            chunks.push({
                x: c * cellWidth,
                y: r * cellHeight,
                width: cellWidth,
                height: cellHeight
            });
        }
    }
                        </code></pre>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        We randomly assign players to these sections, and ensure a rich vein of possible options by populating the remaining map space with varied formations of neutral planets.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="feature-list">
                        <li><strong>2) DELTA TIME: </strong>RELATIVITY REQUIRES A FOUNDATIONAL UNIT OF MEASUREMENT</li>
                    </ul>   
                    <p>
                        If we're going to implement an in-game timer, we need to define time in a quantifiable way.
                        Luckily JavaScript has a built-in system for this that works by starting at the beginning of 1970 and counting every millisecond since then.
                        For reference, we're approaching 1.8 trillion — an intimidating for humans, but computers manage it easily.
                        As I write this, "now" is 1753373496350, but you won't read it until much later.
                        How much later?
                        Easy, just figure out how long it's been since 1970 and subtract my number from yours.
                        We'll apply this same approach in-game, but do the math many times per second instead of just once.
                    </p>
                    <div class="code-block">
                        <pre><code>
update() {
    const now = Date.now();
    let dt = (now - this.gameState.lastUpdate) / 1000;
    this.gameState.lastUpdate = now;
    let speedMultiplier = 1.0;
    if (this.botBattleMode && this.footerManager) {
        speedMultiplier = this.footerManager.getSpeedMultiplier();
        dt *= speedMultiplier;
    }
                        </code></pre>
                    </div>   
                    <p>
                        Let's break this block into two halves.
                        The first is uses JavaScript's system to get the current time and make a comparison.
                        To improve the robustness of the system, though, we don't want to assume this will be consistent.
                        Rather than saying "every second, increment forward one", we'll increase specificity and say "increment forward the amount of time since last measured at a rate of one per second".
                        This distinction has multiple benefits, but chief among them is we're now making full use of the 1000 fractional portions of each second.
                        We've facilitated micro-measurements and allowed logic to be applied with a consistent baseline at a higher rate — instead of seeing things through a strobe light, it has constant vision of the action.
                        This is called delta time (difference between times) and we shorthand it as "dt" in many of the formulas that make up this game, including this one.            
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An immediate usage of this feature is the speed multiplier making up the latter half of the code block.
                        By defining time as a variable, we can now mess with that variable and get different results.
                        By using "dt" across each formula, we can have this time dilation effect work consistently throughout.
                        When you increase the speed with this consistent multiplier, not only will the timer count down more quickly, the troops will also move more quickly, and the planets will speed up their troop generation at the same rate.
                        Keep an eye out for this variable and the way it keeps the system moving in sync regardless of pace.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="feature-list">
                        <li><strong>3) TROOP CREATION: </strong>FORMULA DICTATING A PLANET'S VARIABLE RATE OF PRODUCTION</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Neutral planets spawn with a set number of troops which doesn't increase over time, but player-controlled planets produce troops at variable rates.
                        Since production is tied to size, it's imperative that player's starting planets are of standardized sizes.
                        What makes each round of Galcon unique is neutral planets — their proximity, position, and how long it'll take to replace the troops lost while seizing them.
                        Let's formulate the production rate and implement an on/off switch so neutral planets stay sparsely populated:
                    </p> 
                    <div class="code-block">
                        <pre><code>
update(dt) {
    if (this.owner !== 'neutral') { // player-controlled planets generate new troops continuously
        this.troops = Math.min(999, this.troops + this.productionRate * dt); // production rate is tied to planet size
    }
}
                        </code></pre>
                    </div>  
                    <ul class="feature-list">
                        <li><strong>4) MOVEMENT: </strong>MOBILIZE BATTALIONS AND DIFFERENTIATE ARRIVAL LOGIC</li>
                    </ul>                    
                    <p>
                        This aspect really just involves determining whether the troops in question belong to the same player, and applying addition or subtraction based on that determination.
                        As for troop speed, the original game didn't bother to account for the complexities of orbit, so neither will we to ensure predictability.
                    </p>
                    <div class="code-block">

                        Tense Galcon games had a tendency to get quite frantic, with troops being dispatched multiple times per second when a point of weakness presented itself.
                        We'll need a system responsive enough to account for this, and thorough enough to maximize options when things are tense.
                        First things first, human players need to be able to select their planet.

                        A single click selects their planet, and the next one they click in dispatches troops in that direction.
                        Clicking a blank space deselects all, giving players the option to cancel an action.
                        Double-clicking a planet selects all planets the player controls, and I've also implemented a drag-and-drop box for when you want something in-between.
                        I've also implemented the ability to send only as many troops as you want via an intensity slider, but we'll revisit that a bit later.

                    <p>
                        There are a couple fun features I dreamt up while working on the bones, and I think they'll improve the user experience for the better.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="feature-list">
                        <li><strong>1) REAL-TIME STATS</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        I got the idea to replace the header with a real-time tracking of troops in-game, and tried a couple of approaches before landing on what's in-game now.
                        Since each player is assigned a number (1 through 6), we can easily arrange them in that same configuration in the header, and colour code them accordingly.
                        From there it's division, with player troops as the numerator and total troops as the denominator.
                        That leaves us starting most games with the bar half-white, representing the yet-unconquered populations of neutral planets.
                        It's an addition that provides a much-needed pop of colour while also offering valuable game data at a glance.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The footer also replaces itself in-game with a sliding bar, but the meaning differs dependent on if a human player's involved.
                        For bot-only battles, it converts to a slider bar that controls the aforementioned delta time multiplier, and therefore the speed of the game.
                        In testing I found there were far too many games that ended in stalemates, which meant spending a lot of time watching the intergalactic equivalent of paint drying.
                        Allowing the pace of the game to be quadrupled means you can speed through games without disturbing the results, and slowing games down lets you examine the manoeuvres of the better bots in slow motion.

                        We've done the work to create a responsive UI for players to micro-manage their troops, but there's something missing.
                        Sure, we can select from our planets with precision, but when they get sent out, it's always half.
                        To allow players a bit more granularity, we'll use the footer slider bar to represent the percentage of dispatched troops.

                    <div class="code-block">

                        To give each of our battlebots a fair fight, we need to standardize the way they interact with the game.
                        This is multi-faceted, but we'll start by creating a singular file holding all the functions they'd ever need.
                        Instead of having each bot running their own calculations about, for instance, how long's left in the game, we can do the math once and offer the answer up to anyone who asks.
                        Essentially, it's an API — a real-time repository of data available for request when asked nicely.
                        Our combatants all get the same info about troop movement, production rates, and everything captured in the colourful header bar.
                    </p>
                    <div class="code-block">
                        <pre><code>
example function summarizing API value
                        </code></pre>
                    </div>    
                    <p>
                        If we're going to have LLMs write their own bot scripts, we also need to be fair about the info they're working with.
                        Each of them has a different "context window", or amount of data they're able to accept.
                        My view is that's their fault!
                        All we can do is decide on a priority list and feed as much to the model as they're able to consume.
                        At a minimum, we'll be able to show them the API file and a standardized prompt describing what we want them to output:
                    </p>
                    <div class="code-block">
                        <pre><code>
standardized prompt and how they asked to have it fed to them
                        </code></pre>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        It's taken some effort, but we've assembled a playable game and the means to recruit players.
                        Let's get ready to rumble!
