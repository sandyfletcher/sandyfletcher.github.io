                    <p>
                        There's something very special about moving out, living unencumbered by the parental supervision perpetually around your neck from the day you're born.
                        It's common for people to use it as an opportunity to let loose, eating ice cream for breakfast and liquor for lunch.
                        I used this absence of oversight to allocate a larger chunk of my day to computer games.
                    </p>

                        If someone said that time was wasted, they'd only be mostly right.
                        Imagine a critic admitting they'd only seen a handful of movies prior to getting this movie-reviewing job... would it be reasonable to question the value of their insights?
                        How could they possibly analyze the peaks and valleys of film as a medium when they've only dipped their toe in one part of the river?
                        Surely someone who spent the majority of their day immersed in various games, discussing their intricacies, would've gleaned more, right?  Fingers crossed.

                        A couple months back I found myself reminiscing about this period, living in squalor but loving it, and a particular game came to mind — Galcon.
                        It's online, multiplayer, and akin to a real-time Risk, and our household frequently hosted these galactic throwdowns.
                        At the time I gave it little thought, but the website worked really well.
                        There was no shortage of players, matchmaking was speedy, and the game had struck an addictive balance between skill and luck.
                        Unfortunately for us the game's popularity eventually ended up making it less accessible, and only years later do I understand why.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The adage "there's no such thing as a free lunch" is the easiest way to understand something ostensibly permanent like a website slipping out of existence.
                        Computers use electricity, and typically there's a cost to acquiring that electricity.
                        When you access a website, you're essentially accessing someone else's computer, and they're the ones paying the bill when processing your request.
                        If all you're requesting is a tiny bit of data like the today's temperature reading, that's not a very large bill.
                        Galcon was having hundreds of concurrent users, and they were requesting a low-latency game against opponents globally instead of a simple two-digit number.
                        Their choice was to pivot from a website to an app they could charge an initial cost for, and that'd offset the anticipated elecrical and computing costs.
                        It's a logical decision, but it's one that inevitably curtails the number of new players discovering the game moving forward, and begins its march towards obscurity.

                        This project intends to reignite the game and evaluate whether it has the depth to join the greats of the strategy game realm.
                        I will begin by attempting to recreate the game as faithfully as possible, making it so someone who's never experienced the game can be caught up and enjoy the action.
                        From there I plan to turn it into an arena for LLMs to test their mettle, pitting various models against one another as another data point for our attempt to benchmark and compare offerings.
                        That will likely be the extent of the project, but if the results are intriguing I'd be interested to revisit the project down the line as an opportunity to apply machine learning and craft the ultimate pilot for galactic conquest.

                    <h2>Initial Steps</h2>
                    <p>
                        At this point in my coding journey I don't have a lot of tools at my disposal.
                        The only programming language I'm familiar with capable of making conditional choices is JavaScript, so that'll be what we create both the game and the robot opponents out of.
                        Since I plan to have this be a website rather than a locally-running program, I started by setting up a shell that'll hold the site using HTML and CSS.
                        For simplicity's sake, I've set it up so that content of the site is inflexible; it'll essentially display the same on web as on mobile, and it isn't compatible with landscape mode.
                        As you can tell from the site you're reading and the look of the game, I'm partial to minimalism.
                        Aesthetically I prefer it, and from a practical perspective fewer distractions means people understand how to proceed more intuitively.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After setting up menus, fiddling with fonts, and ensuring there's visual consistency across platforms and viewport sizes, it's time to conceptualize how to recreate the game itself.
                        The crux of the gameplay is that planets generate troops at a rate relative to their physical size, and these troops can be dispatched to neighbouring planets to secure new planets that produce even more troops.
                        Naturally, some planets become contested as multiple players vie for its production capabilities, and troops are traded through mutual attrition.
                        Victory is achieved when one player has completely eliminated all opposing players, or given to the player in the dominant position (most planets controlled) when the timer runs out.
                        From a coding perspective, a lot of this is surprisingly simple when broken down into smaller components: 
                        we need a map generator that follows guardrails to generate a semi-random distribution of planets, we need a simple formula dictating a planet's rate of production, and we need troop movement that understands when it's in battle and when it's reinforcing an allied planet.                        
                    </p>
